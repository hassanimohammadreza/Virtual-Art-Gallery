# Virtual Art Gallery - A CSS Art Showcase

Welcome to my **Virtual Art Gallery**, a website dedicated to celebrating iconic works of art from famous artists while showcasing my journey and experience with **CSS**. This gallery is a virtual space where I pay homage to some of the most influential artists in the history of modern art using only HTML5 and CSS.

### Project Overview
This project is an ongoing and evolving **interactive digital gallery** where visitors can explore the innovative work of artists such as **Mondrian, Albers, Malevich, Rothko, Kusama, Kandinsky, Bridget Riley**, and more, all reimagined through the lens of **CSS**. It serves as both a **virtual gallery** and a **portfolio** of my growing expertise in CSS techniques and web design.

Each artwork presented here is inspired by the respective artist's style, recreated using only CSS properties like **grid layout**, **animations**, **transitions**, and **pseudo-elements** to simulate their unique art pieces. The goal of this project is to create a seamless blend of art and web technology, providing an immersive and educational experience.

### Key Features
- **Virtual Gallery**: Explore various works of art reimagined using pure CSS, including famous pieces by Mondrian, Rothko, Kusama, and more.
- **CSS Artwork**: Every piece in the gallery is created with CSS, demonstrating advanced techniques like **CSS Grid**, **Flexbox**, **CSS animations**, and **pseudo-elements**.
- **Continually Evolving**: The gallery will be continuously updated with more artists, more works, and new techniques as I continue to improve my skills.
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery is built to work seamlessly on all screen sizes, from desktops to tablets to mobile devices.

### Featured Artists and Works

1. **Mondrian**: Known for his abstract geometric compositions with primary colors and black lines.
